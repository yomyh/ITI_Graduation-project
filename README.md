# Parking Sensor Graduation Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Parking Sensor Graduation Project developed during a 1-month training program at ITI (Information Technology Institute) in the field of embedded systems.

## Project Overview

The Parking Sensor project aims to create a system that enhances parking safety by providing real-time distance measurement between a car and an obstacle. The system utilizes four drivers - LED, buzzer, GPIO, ultrasonic sensor, and an LCD - to accurately detect and display the distance.

## Features

- Accurate Distance Measurement: The project incorporates an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance between the car and obstacles with high precision.
- Alarm and LED Indication: When the car's distance is 50 meters or less, the system activates an alarm and LED lights to alert the driver of the approaching obstacle.
- Real-time Monitoring: The system provides real-time distance updates on an LCD display, allowing the driver to make informed parking decisions.
- Cost-effective Solution: The project offers a cost-effective solution for parking safety, utilizing readily available components and microcontrollers.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Parking Sensor project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Connect the necessary components (LED, buzzer, GPIO, ultrasonic sensor, and LCD) to the microcontroller as per the project specifications.
3. Compile and upload the code to the microcontroller.
4. Test the functionality of the parking sensor by observing the distance readings on the LCD and the activation of the alarm and LED lights.
